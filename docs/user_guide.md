Dashboard
Track your study sessions in two modes:
Ongoing Event: When you log in during a scheduled calendar event, a timer automatically appears and counts down the time remaining in that session. You can also view details of your current event - title and description - with the latter containing a list of the Leetcode problems added for this event (if any).
Custom Session: If no event is active, you can start a manual timer. Enter your desired time in minutes in the form field. Toggle your timer with the Start, Pause, and Reset controls.
Note: Live countdowns require JavaScript. If JavaScript is disabled in the browser, the timer will be static and a "Refresh" button is provided that will update the time countdown display on click.


Calendar
You can view your Google Calendar events on the “Calendar” view. Any modifications you make to your calendar events from this application will sync with your Google Calendar.
To Add an Event: Click on the “Add Event” button at the top, this will bring up a form for you to fill in the title, date, and time, then click "Add Event." Your form must at least have an event name, date, and start time (if it is not an all-day event).
You can also click on “Back to Calendar” if you wish to discard your changes.
To Edit an Event: Click on the “Edit” button next to any existing event in the calendar. This will bring up a form where you can make your changes, and click "Update."
