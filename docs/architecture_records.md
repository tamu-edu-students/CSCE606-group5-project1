Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADR-001: User Authentication via Google OAuth
Status: Accepted
Context: We need a secure and user-friendly way for users to sign up and log in. Building a custom authentication system with password management is complex and adds security risks.
Decision: We decided to use Google OAuth as the sole method for user authentication.
Consequences:
Pro: Reduces development time and enhances security by leveraging Google's trusted platform.
Pro: Users do not need to remember a new password, leading to a better user experience.
Con: Users without a Google account cannot use the application. This is an acceptable trade-off for the target audience.

ADR-002: Choice of Database System
Status: Accepted
Context: The application requires a relational database to store user data, events, and stats with clear relationships between them.
Decision: We decided to use PostgreSQL for all environments (development, test, and production).
Consequences:
Pro: PostgreSQL is robust, open-source, and the standard for production-grade Rails applications.
Pro: It is well-supported by Heroku, our intended deployment platform.
Con: Requires developers to have PostgreSQL installed on their local machines, which is a reasonable prerequisite.
